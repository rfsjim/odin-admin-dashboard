# Project: Odin Admin Dashboard

Now that you’ve had plenty of practice using Grid, we are going to build a full dashboard design. For this project, use whatever tools you need to get it done, but try to lean on Grid for the majority of the layout work. Go back through the lessons or practice assignments if you need a refresher.

 Review the project design file and get a general idea for how you’re going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.
